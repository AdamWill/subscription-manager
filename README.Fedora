The subscription-manager-migration package contains the script:

    rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm.

This is a migration script intended to move people from Classic
RHN Hosted to Hosted Candlepin. While unsupported, this
script could also be used to migrate machines from Spacewalk to Candlepin.

If a user wanted to do this, they would need to perform a few steps. First, the
user would have to register their machine with a Spacewalk[1] instance. Then,
they would need to set up Candlepin[2], load product data, and pull down
product certificates into /usr/share/rhsm/product/16/on the system to be
migrated. The product certs can be obtained via REST calls[3]. Additionally, a
file called "channel-cert-mappings.txt" has to be created in the same
directory, and filled out in the following format:

spacewalk-channel-name1: product-cert1-filename.pem
spacewalk-channel-name2: product-cert1-filename.pem
spacewalk-channel-name3: product-cert2-filename.pem

Once that is complete, the user can run "rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm" and
migrate from Spacewalk to Candlepin. Note that for now, the two usernames and
passwords must be identical. This will be corrected in later versions of the
migration script.
