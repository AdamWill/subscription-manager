	<para>
		Effective asset management requires a mechanism to handle the software inventory &mdash; both the type of products and the number of systems that the software is installed on. The subscription management service provides that mechanism and gives transparency into both global allocations of subscriptions for an entire organization and the specific subscriptions assigned to a single system.
	</para>

			<para>
				The basis of software management is a <emphasis>subscription</emphasis>. A subscription contains both the <emphasis>products</emphasis> that are available, the support levels, and the <emphasis>quantities</emphasis>, or number of servers, that the product can be installed on. A subscription is roughly analogous to a user license, in that it grants all of the rights to that product to that system. Unlike a user license, a subscription does not grant the right to <emphasis>use</emphasis> the software; with the subscription model, a subscription grants the ability to download the packages and receive updates. 
			</para>
			<para>
				Subscriptions are managed though a subscription management service such as the Customer Portal Subscription Management (hosted) or an on-premise service like Subscription Asset Manager. A second service delivers the actual software bits, in tandem with the subscriptions managed for a system.
			</para>
			<para>
				The subscription management service maintains a list of every subscription or set of subscriptions for an organization. The list of subscriptions is a <emphasis>pool</emphasis>, identified by a unique ID (called a <emphasis>pool ID</emphasis>). A system is <emphasis>registered</emphasis>, or added, to the subscription management service to allow it to manage the subscriptions for that system. Like the subscription, the system is also added to the subscription management service inventory and is assigned a unique ID within the service. The subscriptions and system entries, together, comprise the <emphasis>inventory</emphasis>.
			</para>
			<para>
				A system allocates, or <emphasis>attaches</emphasis>, one of the quantities of a product in a subscription to itself. 
			</para>
			<para>
				The repository where the product software is located is organized according to the <emphasis>product</emphasis>. Each product group within
				the repository may contain the primary software packages and then any required dependencies or associated packages. Altogether, the product and its
				associated packages are called a <emphasis>content set</emphasis>. (A content set for a product even includes other versions of the product.)
				When a subscription grants access to a product, it includes access to all of the associated packages in that content set.
			</para>
			<para>
				A single subscription can have multiple products, and each system can have multiple different subscriptions, depending on how many entitlement certificates are loaded on the machine.
			</para>

		<secondary>hardware compatibility</secondary>
	</indexterm>
	<indexterm>
		<primary>subscriptions</primary>
		<secondary>hardware compatibility</secondary>
	</indexterm>
			<para>
				Any number of products, for any number of different architectures, can be contained in a single subscription. The subscription options that are visible to a consumer are filtered, by default, according to whether the architecture for the product matches the architecture of the system. This is <emphasis>compatibility</emphasis>. Depending on compatible subscriptions makes sure that subscriptions are allocated efficiently, only to systems which can actually use the products.
			</para>
			<para>
				Some subscriptions define some element count on the system, like the number of sockets, the number of virtual guests on a host, or the number of clients in a domain. Multiple subscriptions can be combined together to cover the counts on the system.
				<!--	For example, if there is a four socket server, two subscriptions for "RHEL Server for Two Sockets" can be consumed by the system to cover the socket count. Combining multiple subscriptions to cover the system count is called <emphasis>stacking</emphasis>.
				-->
			</para>
			<para>
				The subscription tools can display even incompatible subscriptions. Alternatively, the architecture definition for the system can be overridden by defining custom system facts for the subscription tools to use.
			</para>
			<para>
				It is important to distinguish between attaching a subscription for a product and installing a product. A subscription is essentially a statement of whatever products an organization has purchased. The act of attaching a subscription means that a system is allowed to install the product with a valid certificate, but attaching a subscription does not actually perform any installation or updates. In the reverse, a product can also be installed apart from any subscriptions for the system; the system is just does not have a valid product certificate. Red Hat Subscription Manager simplifies product installation by using <command>yum</command> plug-ins that come with its tools.
			</para>
			<para>
				The Red Hat Subscription Manager GUI has a single window with tabbed sections that offer quick views into the current state of the system, showing installed products, subscriptions for the system, and available subscriptions the system has access to. These tabs also allow administrators to manage subscriptions by applying and removing subscriptions from the system.
			</para>
			<para>
				Red Hat Subscription Manager has three main areas to manage products and subscriptions:
			</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The <guibutton>My Subscriptions</guibutton> area shows all of the current subscriptions applied to the system.
					</para>

				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The <guibutton>Available Subscriptions</guibutton> area shows all of the subscriptions that are available to the system. The default displays only subscriptions that are compatible with the hardware, but these can be filtered to show subscriptions corresponding to other installed programs, only subscriptions that have not been installed, and subscriptions based on date.
					</para>

				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The <guibutton>My Installed Products</guibutton> area shows the currently installed products on the system, along with their subscription status. This does not allow administrators to install software, only to view installed software.
					</para>

				Part of a subscription is a defined service level for that product on a given system. Red Hat service levels are defined in the contract; a summary of production support levels is available at <ulink url="https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/sla.html" />.
			</para>
			<para>
				The service information for each subscription is part of the subscription details. Two attributes are displayed, per subscription: its support level and its support type. The <emphasis>level</emphasis> defines how quickly support is guaranteed to respond to a case. The <emphasis>type</emphasis> defines the methods of communication; for production level support, this is always web and phone.
			</para>
			<para>
				An account can have multiple levels of support available, even for the same product. 
					A system can be set up to select subscriptions based on a preferred service level. This is used as a component in autoattaching subscriptions to the system.

		Many IT environments have to be certified to meet a certain level of security or other

		The preferences dialog can set a preferred minor, or <emphasis>y-stream</emphasis>, release
		number for the system to stick to. This limits the system to content repositories associated 
		with that operating system version instead of moving to the newest or latest version repositories. 
		For example, if the preferred operating system version is 6.3, then 6.3 content repositories are 
		preferred for all installed and subscribed products for the system, even if other repositories 
		are available.

			The Red Hat Subscription Manager provides a series of log and UI messages that indicate any changes to the valid certificates of any installed products for a system. In the Subscription Manager GUI, 
			the status of the system subscriptions is color-coded, where <emphasis>green</emphasis> means all subscriptions are attached for all installed products, <emphasis>yellow</emphasis> 
			means that some products may not have all of the required subscriptions attached but updates are still in effect, and <emphasis>red</emphasis> means that updates are disabled.

			Whenever there is a warning about subscription changes, a small icon appears in the notification area of the desktop, similar to a fuel gauge.
		</para>
		<para>
			As any installed product nears the expiration date of the subscription, the Subscription Manager daemon will issue a warning. A similar message is given when the system has products without a valid certificate, meaning either there is not subscription attached that covers that product or the product is installed past the expiration of the subscription. Clicking the <guilabel>Manage My Subscriptions...</guilabel> button in the subscription notification window opens the Red Hat Subscription Manager GUI to view and update subscriptions.
